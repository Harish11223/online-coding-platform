# 🧠 CodeForge

CodeForge is a **LeetCode-style online coding platform** that allows users to solve programming problems, write and run code, and submit solutions for evaluation in multiple languages.

The platform uses a **self-hosted Judge0 (Docker)** instance running on **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)** for secure code execution, along with a **Node.js backend** and a **React (Vite) frontend** featuring **Monaco Editor** for a VS Code–like experience.
